# RustBankAccounts
 Learning the Rust language model using structs, loops, mutability, and functions.

 I created a program that lets the user create a bank account and then gives them the option
 to deposit to an account and withdraw from an account until they want to exit the program.

 Used Visual Studio Code for my IDE with the rust-analyzer extension.
